# hard limit at startup regardless of what this ulimit sets, so a low ceiling here
# only ever capped everything in the tree uniformly (including one-shot MCP
# children like chrome-devtools-mcp, which needs a ~270-fd burst at startup and
# was dying to EMFILE against the old 256 default). Set well above any legitimate
